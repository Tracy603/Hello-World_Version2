# Hello-World_Version2

Revision 2.1

This is a revisitation of the GitHub assignment.  I didn't really get it the first time around.  Redoing this project will help me to master the program.

This is the addition of information about me.  

I live in Auburn, NH
I have one cat named Tigger.  
I like to knit, play the harp, and garden.
I also like to read.
I used to be a math teacher, but I'm seekiing a new career with half the work and twice the pay.
